# MNIST Digit Recognition Neural Network From Scratch

Handwritten digit recognition using a neural network built from scratch with NumPy.

## Features

- MNIST dataset (42,000 training samples)
- 2-layer feedforward network
- Softmax classifier for 10 digits
- Manual backpropagation implementation
- 85% accuracy achieved

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results

The network achieves 85% accuracy on the development set after 500 iterations of gradient descent,
demonstrating successful implementation of backpropagation from scratch.
